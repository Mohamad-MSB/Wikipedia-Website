    <h1>London Has Fallen</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>London Has Fallen </strong> is a 2016 American action thriller film directed by Babak Najafi and written
        by Creighton Rothenberger, Katrin Benedikt, Chad St. John and Christian Gudegast. It is a sequel to Antoine
        Fuqua's 2013 film Olympus Has Fallen and stars Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman, with Alon Moni
        Aboutboul, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Jackie Earle Haley, Melissa Leo, Radha Mitchell, Sean O'Bryan, Waleed
        Zuaiter and Charlotte Riley in supporting roles. It is the second installment in the Fallen film series. The
        film follows a plot to assassinate the world leaders of the G7 as they attend the British Prime Minister's
        funeral in London, and Secret Service agent Mike Banning's efforts to protect US President Benjamin Asher from
        being killed by the terrorists.

        Filming began in London on October 24, 2014. A Christmas break started in November with filming resuming in
        February 2015. The film was released by Focus Features under their recently revived Gramercy Pictures label on
        March 4, 2016, and grossed $205 million worldwide. However, the critical reception was generally negative, with
        Variety accusing it of fear-mongering and "terrorsploitation" while The A.V. Club named it worst film of the
        year.

        A third film, titled Angel Has Fallen, was released on August 23, 2019. </p>

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>G8 intelligence services locate Pakistani arms trafficker and terrorist mastermind Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni
        Aboutboul) at his compound on the outskirts of Lahore, and authorize a US Air Force drone strike during his
        daughter's wedding, killing Barkawi's family and seemingly Barkawi himself.

        Two years later, British Prime Minister James Wilson suddenly dies, and the G7 prepare to attend his funeral in
        London. Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) assigns agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) to lead
        American President Benjamin Asher's (Aaron Eckhart) overseas security detail, even though Banning's wife Leah
        (Radha Mitchell) is due to give birth in a few weeks. The entourage arrives via Air Force One at Stansted
        Airport, and Banning arranges an earlier arrival at Somerset House in London via Marine One.

        As Asher's Presidential State Car arrives at St Paul's Cathedral, a group of mercenaries led by Barkawi's son
        Kamran (Waleed Zuaiter) launch coordinated attacks on the city disguised as Metropolitan Police, the Queen's
        Guardsmen, and other first responders, killing five Western leaders, damaging major landmarks and generating
        mass panic. Asher's early arrival throws off the St. Paul's attack, and Banning returns him and Jacobs to Marine
        One. The terrorists destroy the helicopter's escorts with Stinger missiles, forcing the damaged helicopter to
        crash-land in Hyde Park. Fatally injured, Jacobs makes Banning promise to stay alive for his unborn child, and
        to punish those responsible. Banning escorts Asher into the London Underground as the city's power is lost and
        residents shelter indoors.

        In Washington, D.C., American Vice President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) investigates the incident with
        British authorities while trying to track down the President. He receives a call from Barkawi, still alive after
        all and operating in Sanaa. Seeking revenge for the drone strike that killed his daughter, and having poisoned
        Wilson to lure the G7 to London, Barkawi knows Asher is still alive, and promises that if Kamran captures him,
        he will broadcast Asher's execution online. Trumbull orders his staff to locate Barkawi's known operatives and
        find any connection to the attack, while British authorities stand down all first responders so any left in the
        open can be identified as terrorists.

        After leaving a sign to be picked up by satellite, Banning leads Asher to an MI6 safe-house, where agent
        Jacquelin "Jax" Marshall (Charlotte Riley) briefs them. Marshall receives a voice message from Trumbull that
        they saw Banning's sign and an extraction team is en route. Security monitors display an approaching Delta Force
        team, but Banning realizes they have arrived too soon and are actually Barkawi mercenaries. He fights them off
        and drives away with Asher, but their car is struck before they can reach the US Embassy, and Asher is taken.
        Banning is rescued by the combined Delta/SAS extraction team, who suspect a mole in the British government.

        Trumbull's staff identify a building owned by one of Barkawi's front companies, drawing massive power despite
        being unoccupied, and realize it is Kamran's headquarters. Banning joins the extraction team to infiltrate the
        building, arriving seconds before Kamran can decapitate Asher. Kamran escapes when his hacker Sultan Mansoor
        (Mehdi Dehbi) drops a grenade with his dying breath, forcing Banning to protect Asher from the blast. Banning
        and Asher escape just before the building is destroyed by the Delta Force/SAS squad, killing Kamran and the
        remaining terrorists. Marshall and British authorities restore London's security system and, discovering that
        MI5 Intelligence Chief John Lancaster (Patrick Kennedy) was Barkawi's mole, she kills him when he resists
        arrest. Trumbull tells Barkawi that his plan failed, moments before US federal authorities destroy the building
        armed with another drone strike, killing Barkawi and the remaining members of his terrorist group.

        Two weeks later, Banning is home spending time with Leah and their newborn child Lynne, named after Jacobs. As
        Banning contemplates sending a letter of resignation, he watches Trumbull speak on television regarding the
        recent events, with a message that the U.S. will prevail. Inspired, Banning deletes the letter. </p>
